Figure 5.1. The Camera Eye

 

From layout, to color, to texture, to type, I’ve been talking about imagery since the beginning of this book. So why should there be a chapter dedicated to imagery alone, right at the end? As with typography, there are many practical concerns related to imagery—including file-type choices, image resolution, and photography sources—that we need to cover. But, naturally, there are also artistic aspects to this topic, and these deserve some detailed discussion.

 

The process of choosing photographic, iconic, and illustrative elements for a website design requires a basic understanding of the design principles I covered in the first few chapters. Take *Figure 5.1*, for instance. I wanted to use an image of a camera at the top of this page as an iconic representation of the subject. However, when I was looking for a suitable picture, my decision was based more on the angle of the image than the type of camera pictured. The direction that the camera faces in this picture greatly affects the sense of movement in this page. If the camera were facing straight ahead, the page would look just fine, but it would _feel_ static. If it were facing off to the right, your eye would gravitate off the page rather than into the content. This phenomenon is due to the rules of emphasis that I talked about in Chapter 1. The placement of the camera at the top of this page helps to ensure it will be noticed. Isolating the image makes it stand out even more as a focal point. Finally, the direction of the lens creates a line of continuance that determines the next focal point of the page.

 

By the end of this chapter, you’ll understand these concepts, and know how to apply them to your own designs.

 

## What to Look For

 

The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words certainly holds true on the Web. Photographs and illustrations often serve as visual lures that catch passing visitors and reel them into your content. On the other hand, the wrong images, or even a poor presentation of the right ones, can be detrimental to a website’s appeal. Every viewer of a photograph or illustration sees that image differently, depending on the person’s own background and individual experience. So the thousand words that one person draws from an image may be different from the thousand words another person takes from it.

 

Before you choose an image or illustration to include in the layout or content of a website, ask yourself the following three questions:

Is it relevant?
:    Relevant images can add interest to your design and enhance the content of a web page. They provide visual bookmarks that help visitors remember what was covered on the page, and where to look when they return. Take a look at the promo page for [Grovemade](http://grovemade.com/)’s hand-made products in *Figure 5.2*. The background photograph is visually compelling and relevant, giving the page a workshop vibe and personality that another image may be unable to replicate. This is a logical rule that most people get right when they choose images for content; however, relevance is only one factor to consider when choosing an image.

    ![Grovemade's hand-made products](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000000.jpg)

    Figure 5.2. Grovemade's hand-made products 

Is it interesting?
:    Although it’s important to maintain a connection between the visual elements of a design and its content, you should avoid always making it priority number one. The problem with looking for relevant imagery is that we often become caught in the trap of being too literal. And when it comes to choosing images, the land of literal is where all clichés are born.

 If you were designing a website for a Tex-Mex restaurant, what type of image would you immediately choose? I think my gut instinct would be “happy people eating nachos.” This is definitely not an image you’ll find on the [Tijuana Flats](http://www.tijuanaflats.com/) website in *Figure 5.3*. Instead, you’re treated to an atmosphere that’s completely unexpected—an old fashioned arcade game turned into a website interface. The concept is ingenious, with the arcade buttons as social media buttons, and the careers link in the top left is a ticket that actually slides out of the slot when you hover over it. The restaurant's promotions and important information are displayed on the game screen. The entire design has a retro video game vibe that just works, while being thematically irrelevant to a Tex-Mex restaurant.

 ![Tijuana Flats breaks the mold of convention](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000079.jpg)

 Figure 5.3. Tijuana Flats breaks the mold of convention </dd> <dt font-size="2,2,3,3" class="sc-AykKE sc-fzXfLP cgNtka">Is it appealing?</dt> <dd font-size="2,2,3,3" class="sc-AykKE sc-fzXfLP dIJSSo"> Images that are aesthetically or emotionally appealing can be a very efficient hook for attention and emphasis. The issue is that beauty and attractiveness are different for everyone. Depending on the subject matter and target audience of the site you’re designing, an appealing image might be a portrait of a mother and her child, a panoramic cityscape, or an adorable cartoon mascot.

 Appealing images are especially important for sites dealing with restaurants, recipes, and catering. If the food seen on the website fails to make your mouth water, customers will avoid eating, cooking, or ordering it. The images on the [Olivia Restaurant site](http://oliviarestauranter.no/), seen in *Figure 5.4*, are amazing. They create an atmosphere that makes you want to get in the car and head for the nearest location. An image like this doesn't just express the idea of a great restaurant, but also suggests a great experience awaits you there. The chef doesn't just look like a regular old cook, he looks like an artisan, with amazing craftsmanship.

I realize that relevancy, interest, and appeal are all very subjective, but sometimes subjectivity and artistic license are appropriate. If you think it’s a good image for the project, run with it. Generally speaking, I’d avoid monsters, slime, and aliens in most websites, but as we’ve seen above, given the right client and target audience, it may be a valid design direction. For every image you choose for a design, you need to be able to answer “yes” to at least two of the questions above. Why not all three? Well, sometimes it’s fun to toss in an appealing and interesting image that has nothing to do with your content. You know, like a bunch of birds carrying a whale in a net (the famous Twitter “fail whale”, shown in *Figure 5.5*).

## Legitimate Image Sources

 

So where does one acquire interesting, appealing, and relevant imagery to use for a website project? You basically have three options: create it yourself, purchase stock images, or hire a professional. The approach you take will depend on the budget and needs of your client, as well as your own skills.

 

### Take It or Make It

 

For me, taking pictures with my own camera or creating my own illustrations is usually a win/win situation. If local clients need pictures to use on their websites, it gives me a chance to escape the office and do something different for a change. I’ve had the opportunity to take pictures of products, restaurants, a factory, apartments, a martial arts studio, storefronts—I was even able to ride around in a golf cart to take pictures of a golf course one morning, all while I was on the clock. But it’s more than just a fun outing for me. Clients usually like the idea because it shows them that I want to be involved in every step of the project. It can also cost them less than it would to contract a professional photographer.<sup> [9]</sup>

 

The same is usually true for illustration and animation work. Most of the time, a custom site design requires some level of illustration. For items like icons, buttons, backgrounds, basic drawings, and logos, you might consider taking a stab at fulfilling the client’s needs yourself. Keep in mind that illustration doesn’t necessarily have to be complex or time-consuming for the message to be communicated successfully. Take a look at the website for the agency [Designzillas](http://www.designzillas.com/) in *Figure 5.6*. The cartoon dinosaur isn't necessarily complicated, but it serves as a mascot for the company, and immediately gets your attention. The bright green and yellow work well with the black background, too.

 

![The Ferocious Designzillas Website](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000140.jpg)

 

Figure 5.6. The Ferocious Designzillas Website

 

Occasionally, the do-it-yourself method doesn’t work out for me. The illustration work the client needs might be outside my skill set, or it may be too complex for me to feel confident taking it on. If it’s a particular photo the client wants, I might lack access to the subject, or the quality of the image they need may be beyond the capabilities of my equipment. In those cases, my first instinct and the next best option is to turn to stock photography and illustrations.

 

### Stock Photography

 

If you’re short on the time or ability to create or commission your own images, chances are that you’ll find what you’re looking for in a stock photo archive. These photo archives, or image banks, consist of photographs and illustrations that are created for general use, rather than a specific client or project. For a licensing fee (or sometimes for free), you can select any of these images for use in your project.

 

Finding the right images and photos for a design project can be a difficult task, depending on the subject matter and your budget. If your project requires pictures of animals, scenic vacation destinations, office supplies, or some random inanimate object, then you’re likely to find what you’re looking for easily. Every stock photo archive has these types of subjects well covered. Finding photos of people—like the girl with the unnaturally blue eyes and curiously long sleeves on the [Brochure Ninjas](http://www.brochureninjas.com/) site in *Figure 5.7*—can be a little trickier; most stock photo sites require that the photographer submit a signed model release for any image that includes a person’s face.

 

![Photos of people, like this one at Brochure Ninjas, can be more expensive](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000165.jpg)

 

Figure 5.7. Photos of people, like this one at Brochure Ninjas, can be more expensive

 

For this reason, you should expect to pay for good-quality pictures of people. Finally, if you need pictures of a product logo, current celebrity, or famous work of art, you have some work to do. Even though you may be able to find these sorts of images easily on search engines, using them for a professional project will likely require a very detailed licensing agreement.

 

#### Always Look for Image Usage Guidelines

Even if an image is restriction-free, you should ensure that your use of the image falls within the guidelines of the site’s image licensing agreement. The guidelines for each stock photography source differs, so be sure you know what these are before you start looking for images. Some galleries even restrict their images to personal and non-profit use.

 

The next question you must answer before you begin your quest for the perfect stock image is: how much are you willing to pay? The price of using a single stock photograph can range from zero to hundreds of dollars. As you can probably imagine, the average quality of free images is dramatically lower than those for which you’d pay. Free images can still be worth your while, though; you just might have to wade through a bunch of crummy pictures before you find what you’re after. The same goes for expensive images. Just because you’re willing to pay $500 for a single photo, there’s no guarantee you’ll receive a Ferrari instead of an early ’90s Chrysler minivan with faux wood paneling. No matter what the licensing price of an image is, it all boils down to finding what you’re looking for. If you can find it quickly, and at a great price, you’ll have more time to spend on the design.

 

Three tiers of stock photography are available: free, royalty-free, and rights-managed. Let’s look at each of these now.

 

#### Free Images

I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch”. That idiom could be applied to just about everything, and it definitely applies to the world of stock photography. Even though there are some excellent free stock images available, somebody is still paying for the equipment and the time it takes to create those images. Why would photographers do all this for free? For the same reason a talented musician might publish free MP3s, or a team of programmers might spend time on an open source project. It’s what they love to do, it allows many more people to enjoy their work, and it’s an opportunity for their work to be noticed.

 

Of all the free stock photography sources out there, the one with the largest collection of free images, and the one that I use most often, is [Free Images,](http://www.freeimages.com/) pictured in *Figure 5.8*.

 

![Free Images, a great source of imagery](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000154.jpg)

 

Figure 5.8. Free Images, a great source of imagery

 

Free Images has over 400,000 high-quality, user-submitted images. To ensure the quality and relevance of the gallery’s database, site moderators check each submission before it becomes available. When you’re downloading images from Free Images, be sure to check the restriction status of the image. Most images in the database are restriction-free, which means that you can use them for most personal or commercial uses.

Figure 5.9. Image from Old Book Illustrations

 

The size of a stock photography collection plays a big role in how useful it can be. The more photos there are for a given search term, the more likely you are to find one that’s useful. Although there are many free stock photo resources online, most of them have significantly fewer images, or the images they do have cover very specific, narrow topics. One such niche site for images is [Old Book Illustrations.](http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/)The site has a large collection of scanned artwork and illustrations, like the image in Figure 5.9, that are all old enough to be in the public domain. You can find a list of other sources for public domain images at Wikipedia’s [listing for public domain image resources.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources)

 

If you’ve spent any time looking for the right stock image, you’ll know that finding what you need can be a frustrating experience. Sometimes you’ll spend more time searching than designing, and when it’s a client project you’re working on, you simply can’t afford to waste time. When you’re willing to pay a little for the right image, the task of finding that image becomes much easier. That’s when paid stock images, which generally come in two flavors—royalty-free and rights managed—come to the fore.

 

#### Royalty-free Images

Contrary to what you might think, a royalty-free image is not available for use free of charge. The term refers to the details of the image’s licensing agreement. A royalty-free image license is one that allows you to pay a single, up-front fee for an image. The payment buys you the right to use that image for other clients and projects without paying further licensing fees, known as royalties. As you can imagine, this is a popular option with designers who may need the same types of images again and again, and want to avoid the hassle of negotiating usage rights. One of the most popular places to purchase royalty-free stock photography is [iStockphoto,](http://www.istockphoto.com/) shown in *Figure 5.10*.

 

While many of the larger stock photo sites only source content from professional photographers, iStockphoto makes it easy for anyone to put their photos, illustrations, even audio or video up for sale. To maintain the quality and diversity of the iStockphoto collection, the site administrators accept only high-quality images and often reject subjects on which they already have an abundance of imagery.

 

![iStockphoto search for “happy person”](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000130.jpg)

 

Figure 5.10. iStockphoto search for “happy person”

 

The reason for the difference in quality between stock imagery from Free Images and iStockphoto is quite simple. iStockphoto pays its artists; therefore, the site attracts more submissions of higher quality. Purchasing images here is based on a credit system. Once you’ve created an account, you can purchase a pack of credits, which is sort of like buying tickets for a carnival. The price of these credits ranges from around $1 to around $1.50 per credit; the more credits you buy, the cheaper they are. Standard images on iStockPhoto range from 2 to 25 credits, depending on the size of image you need, and some images have a higher tariff, too. I know what you’re thinking: $1.50 per credit times 25 credits is $37.50 per image. On the Web, though, you typically only need one of the smaller image sizes that cost 10 credits or less. Another service that’s similar to iStockphoto but slightly less expensive is [Dreamstime.](http://www.dreamstime.com/)While iStockPhoto used to be my go-to resource, I’ve found that I can usually find what I’m looking for in Dreamstime’s collection, which also features a growing number of free images.

 

If you plan to download a lot of stock photography, paying by the image can become expensive, even at 2 credits apiece. An alternative to the credit-based system is to pay for a subscription service. A few stock photography providers do not sell images individually; rather, they charge a monthly subscription fee that allows you to download whatever you need. [Depositphotos.com](http://depositphotos.com/) and [Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com/) are two such providers. Although these types of services generally cost around $100/month, they offer discounts for customers who purchase multiple months’ access at a time.

 

#### Rights-managed Images

A third level of stock photography service is known as rights-managed. This type of stock photography can be quite a bit pricier than the others, as you pay a fee based on the size of your business, the number of people who will be exposed to the image, and the amount of time for which the image will be in use. Most of the larger stock providers have rights-managed options for their exclusive images; for example, [Corbis,](http://www.corbisimages.com/) and [Getty Images.](http://www.gettyimages.com/) The photos in a rights-managed collection are usually of a professional quality.

 

Because the company in charge of the rights knows who’s using the images and for how long, it’s extremely unlikely that your client’s competitor will have the exact same image on its home page that you’ve used for your client. With such a large pool of royalty-free images available, this may already seem improbable, but whether people notice it or not, this happens all the time. 

[TinEye](http://www.tineye.com/) is a great tool for checking how widespread the use of a particular stock image is. This browser plugin touts itself as a reverse image search engine. You simply right-click on an image that you want to research, and it searches for matches in its index of nearly two billion images. As you can see in Figure 5.11, it will even find heavily modified versions of the original image. It’s important to note here that, while there are many images of female customer service representatives with microphone headsets on stock photography sites, it’s a horribly overused cliché. You should think twice before using this type of image, or any picture you can conceive involving business people standing around or shaking hands. The irony here is that the ad in the TinEye sidebar includes a different picture of a headset girl. They’re everywhere, I tell you!

 

![TinEye search results for a popular iStockPhoto image](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000177.jpg)

 

Figure 5.11. TinEye search results for a popular iStockPhoto image

 

While shelling out extra money for rights-managed photography may help your clients to avoid this type of scenario, there’s no real guarantee of exclusivity. If you need to, the best option is to have photos taken professionally.

 

## Getting Professional Help

 

If you plan to hire a professional photographer to do your dirty work, be sure to find one who has experience with commercial photography and the type of shots you’re looking for. That excellent photographer that captured your brother-in-law’s tears at your cousin’s wedding, for instance, may be great at portraiture and event shots, but might know nothing about architectural or product photography.

 

The best way to find a good commercial photographer is by word of mouth. If you know of other companies that have hired a professional photographer, ask about who they use on a regular basis, and their experience. If you don’t have any references you can ask, try starting with a local professional association. If you’re in the US, the [American Photographic Artists website](http://www.apanational.com/) is a great place to start. Many of the photographers listed in the APA database have biographies and portfolios that can give you a good idea of their capabilities.

 

To have an accurate handle on the costs, be very specific when writing a request for proposal. Be sure to include the details of each shot you need. State where you’d like to have the pictures taken if they’re going to be done outside the photographer’s studio, and be ready (with models, locations, wardrobes, and so on) to take all the pictures on the same day if possible. Most professional photographers charge by the day or half-day. Daily rates can vary quite a bit, depending on the market and the photographer’s experience, but they can range from just under one thousand to several thousand dollars. Another aspect to take into consideration is the photographer’s copyright and usage guidelines. Many photographers will grant full ownership of the original photographs to your client upon payment. Some will require credit if the work is used in a commercial publication. A few photographers may require that they retain exclusive rights to the pictures they take, and they’ll charge per use of the photos. You should try to negotiate full ownership and usage permissions whenever possible, but keep in mind that this type of contract may cost more.

 

If it’s a professional illustrator you’d like to hire, another resource to look into is [Hire an illustrator!](http://hireanillustrator.com/i/) This industry index hosts over 300 artists, and makes it easy to find the person for the job by name, style, medium, or location. As with hiring a photographer, though, the best way to find the person for the job is often by word of mouth. In the past, I’ve helped organize a web conference here in Columbia, South Carolina called [Converge SE.](http://convergese.com/) I credit a lot of the success and personality of past years' events to the older version of the site that had illustrations of the bizarre “convergent creatures” (like Sharktopus, seen on the home page on *Figure 5.12*) that were drawn by Giovanni DiFeterici.

 

![The Converge SE site, featuring Sharktopus](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000122.jpg)

 

Figure 5.12. The Converge SE site, featuring Sharktopus

 

I’ve had the opportunity to meet Giovanni and many other local designers, developers, photographers, animators, videographers, and more at local user group meetups. If you live in or near a big city, chances are there are user groups for whatever branch of the web, tech, or design industry you’re interested in. These are great places to find the talent you need to complete your next project, or even to hire for your team.

 

No matter what sources you use for your images—whether they’re from a free stock website like Free Images, or a paid professional creates them—it’s ultimately your clients who should have the final say. Even though it’s likely that you’ll be choosing the images that you feel best represent their company, sometimes your clients will disagree with your choices. Always be ready to adapt and make changes where necessary. As long as you’re creating good work and acquiring your images from legitimate sources, your hard work should pay off, and the client will be impressed.

 

## How Not to Impress

 

So I’ve told you about a few resources where you can obtain imagery for your projects. Now it’s time to talk about where_not_to source imagery from.

 

### Google Ganking

 

As a web designer, you may find it inspirational to run a Google image search for topics around which you’re building a website. Let’s say you’re building a website for a bike shop. If the owner of the shop has yet to give you any images to work with, doing an image search for mountain biking, bike races, road bikes, and other related subjects can give you a better visual understanding of the topic, and an idea about the types of images you’ll want to use on the site. Usually, this type of search will return some images that would work well in your design. You might even feel the urge to save some of these images to your computer, open them up in Photoshop, and crop, resize, and modify them a little to fit your needs. This is known as **Google Ganking**, and it’s a serious problem in web design. Unless the images on a website are specifically marked as being free to use or available in the public domain, you can assume that they’re copyrighted by the site’s owner, so you’ll need permission to use them. You may think that image owners will never notice that you’ve ripped off their work, but you risk facing embarrassment when a cease-and-desist letter is sent to your client, or worse still, the more serious situation of a lawsuit.

 

The same is true for the most part with images found via a Flickr search. While most Flickr images are copyrighted by their respective owners, the service also allows uploaders to give their images one of several standard [Creative Commons (CC) licenses.](http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/)These licenses provide a series of predefined rules for what you can and can’t do with the licensed works. One of the license options allows images to be used for commercial purposes. *Figure 5.13* shows a search for photos of chipmunks that have a license allowing commercial use. This is the same search I did on Free Images in *Figure 5.8*—but instead of 50 results, I received 2,423. You can see why I’ve seen a few resources lately that point to CC Flickr images as a great alternative to using stock photography. While it’s a great image resource, it is_not_stock photography. At the bare minimum, any image you use from Flickr requires attribution. If you fail to provide a credit link for every Flickr image you use, you might as well be stealing them.

 

![Flickr search for CC-licensed chipmunk photos for commercial use](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000123.jpg)

 

Figure 5.13. Flickr search for CC-licensed chipmunk photos for commercial use

 

### Hotlinking

 

If there’s anything that designers hate more than seeing their designs or images ripped off, it’s seeing them ripped off by a site that’s linking to the files on the designers’ own servers. Usually, images for a website are placed on the same web server as the site, and are linked to in the way shown here:

 

``` <img src="/images/image.jpg" alt="Image Description" /> ```

 

However, images can also be linked to from outside the website, using the full URL of the image:

 

``` <img src="http://www.somesite.com/images/image.jpg" alt="Image Description " /> ```

 

Going back to my theoretical bike shop example, let’s suppose I wanted to use a picture of a particular make and model of bike. Let’s say I found an image of the right bike on the manufacturer’s site and wanted to use it. Rather than requesting product images from the manufacturer, or even downloading the image and placing it on my client’s web server, let’s imagine I decide to link straight to the image on the bike manufacturer’s website. This dubious practice is called **hotlinking**.

 

Copyright issues aside, hotlinking uses the bandwidth of the website on which the images are located. With most hosting accounts, bandwidth is limited and extra bandwidth can be expensive. So as a real-world metaphor, hotlinking is a bit like using another person’s cell phone minutes to make your call. Most web professionals know that hotlinking is a big no-no, so the usual hotlinking suspects are forum users, bloggers, and MySpace users who don’t know any better. So if you were unaware before, now you know better, too. Not to mention an additional problem with hotlinked images: the source of the image could pull or remove that image and replace it with something crude or embarrassing at any time.

 

### Clipart

 

There are many websites that offer free, or very cheap, clipart and illustration packages. While these cheesy generic graphics may work for an internal company bulletin or do-it-yourself greeting card, they should be considered off-limits for any professional project.

 

![Clipart could make this happen to YOU](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000026.jpg)

 

Figure 5.14. Clipart could make this happen to YOU

 
You may think that I’m being a little harsh with that statement, but take a moment to think about it. If you go to a five-star restaurant, would you expect to be served instant mashed potatoes from a box? Of course not! You’d expect fresh ingredients, cooked from scratch. As a designer, you have an obligation to cook something up for your client that’s as original as it is astonishing. While the quality and “freshness” of stock photography can be questionable as well, there’s nothing worse than seeing a good design blemished by stale, clichéd clipart. If your clients ask you to use clipart or a corny animated GIF on their site, you should push back a little. Just remember that if the client has come to you for the design, it’s your job to provide feedback that’ll make their site look good. However, you also have to remember that, ultimately, the client is always right. Sometimes a client will force a design decision, and you’ll just have to go with it. I guess some people really like their instant potatoes.

 

Regardless of how good a job you’ve done choosing images for your design, there’s another critical factor to consider: presentation. When you’re formatting images for use on your site, their presentation will often depend on the constraints of the layout you’ve chosen. The image size, for instance, may depend on the size of the rectangle you have available in your grid. As the designer, it’s up to you to determine how an image will be cropped, if an image will have any framing or borders, and what types of visual effects will be applied to the image, if any.

 

## Creative Cropping

 

One of the most profound impacts you can make on the presentation of an image comes from wisely choosing what should be included, and what should not. This process is known as **cropping**, and is a fundamental image manipulation technique.

 

At its most basic level, cropping can be used to eliminate unnecessary or unsightly details from a picture. The picture in *Figure 5.15* is one that I took while wandering around with my wife in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. It’s an okay picture, but the people in the immediate foreground and the power lines that run down the shady right-hand side of the street are distracting.

By cropping out some of the bottom and the right side of the photo, the entire image—shown in *Figure 5.15*—feels less busy, more like a casual holiday shot. In the original photo, the perspective made the church steeple the focal point, but the image included too many other elements that competed for viewers’ attention. With the image cropped, the steeple is still the focal point, but the pair of shoppers jumps out as a secondary focus, due, in part, to the rule of thirds I talked about in Chapter 1. Even though the steeple is no longer in the center of the composition, the perspective lines that run along the top of the buildings, the edge of the road, and even the yellow line point toward the steeple’s base. Having this off-center element as the focal point of the image creates a more interesting composition, and helps to give the image a more intentional, balanced feel.

We can also crop images in unexpected ways to portray a sense of emotion, show an interesting perspective, or change the overall message of the image. In Figure 5.17, an image of a guitar player has been cropped tightly to show only the body of the guitar. This treatment highlights the sense of movement that’s inherent in a musical performance, and provides a degree of anonymity that allows more people to connect with the image.

Figure 5.17. Tight cropping to give an image a sense of emotion and movement

 

When cropping images tightly, like the guitar image above, it’s important to be aware of the overall size of the image you’re working with. You may want to crop to a very detailed area of the photo and then enlarge it, but if the image’s resolution is too low, the cropped image will look pixelated.<sup> [10]</sup> Fortunately, images that are used on the Web can have much lower resolutions than those used in print, but always check the quality of your final image to make sure that it isn’t grainy or blurry.

 

Images don’t always have to be contained in boxes. Many of the fun and useful ways in which we can crop photos are more creative than just trimming off the sides. The photo in *Figure 5.18* is one that I took from the banks of the Saluda River. I love this picture so much in its unedited form that I made it into a background image for my computer, but let’s try to think outside the box.

 

![The Saluda River](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000024.jpg)

 

Figure 5.18. The Saluda River

 

Unconventional cropping methods can come off as amateur if they’re poorly executed, but if they’re done well, they can be used to create some very striking graphics. Let’s say I was designing a website for an outdoor center that rented kayaks for use on the Saluda River. In that case, I might use a technique like the one illustrated in Figure 5.19.

 

![River image cropped around a kayaking shape](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000022.jpg)

 

Figure 5.19. River image cropped around a kayaking shape

 

Here, I’ve used a vector image of a pair of kayakers as a mask around which to crop my original Saluda River picture. In image editing software, a mask is basically a window through which you can see the image. When I laid the mask of the kayakers over the image of the river, I produced the top half of *Figure 5.19*. By flipping the mask vertically, and applying it to a blue-tinted duplicate of the original, I was able to create the appearance of a reflection.

 

Now that image might work for a kayak rental center website, but what if we were creating images for a website that promoted a regional visitor center? The center wouldn’t want to limit the river as only great for kayaking. It’s also a great area for swimming, hiking, and fishing. By using the text “RIVER” as a mask in *Figure 5.20*, I’ve made the image much more versatile, while establishing a fresh and creative look.

 

![Using text as a mask to crop the Saluda River image](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000081.jpg)

 

Figure 5.20. Using text as a mask to crop the Saluda River image

 

One final non-rectangular approach to cropping involves removing an image entirely from a scene. The part of the image that we remove is known as a **knockout**. A knocked-out image can be featured without a background, placed onto another image, or even duplicated and rotated several times to make a flower. Okay, so maybe the last example of using a knockout in Figure 5.21 is a bit far-fetched, but you have to admit that my banana flower looks fairly darn cool.

 

![Knockout examples: bananas sans background, bananas in the sky, and a banana flower](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000186.jpg)

 

Figure 5.21. Knockout examples: bananas sans background, bananas in the sky, and a banana flower

 

As you can see, cropping provides endless possibilities for the production of unique images and design elements. The only limiting factors are your imagination and the ability to flesh out ideas in Photoshop.

 

## Photoshop Adjustments

 

While many software packages are available to help us edit images, Adobe Photoshop has long been my tool of choice. Despite its steep price tag and learning curve, my work flow would suffer without it. It’s the genuine Swiss Army knife of image-editing software packages, and the undisputed industry standard. Other tools may be cheaper, but they only have the blade, or the nail file, or maybe just the cheap plastic toothpick. Photoshop, on the other hand, slices, dices, and creates convincing watercolor-styled images in milliseconds. I’ll refer to Photoshop quite often in the following discussion; however, most of the topics I’m going to talk about here are basic image adjustments that come standard (in some form or another) with just about every image-editing software on offer. I guess what I’m saying is that this section is really about image adjustments, or “photo-shopping” with a lowercase “p.”

 

When I’m taking personal pictures with my digital camera, I usually try to think a little about composition and lighting, but as I’m no real photography pro, my photos generally don’t turn out so great. Those “not so great” images often go straight to my personal photo gallery as records of places or events. If I’m taking a picture for a design project, though, these images always undergo some form of change before they’re suitable for use in client work. At a minimum, the changes I’ll make usually include cropping, and altering the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the photo.

 

*Figure 5.22* is an example of a photo straight from my digital camera. It’s a picture of the amazing stonework around the entrance to the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, that I took during a visit last summer. It’s an okay photograph, but it’s definitely unfit for professional use. Even as a straight content image, it has competing focal points and feels unbalanced.

 

![Another raw photo: the entrance of the Biltmore Estate](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000178.jpg)

Figure 5.23. Initial cropping of Biltmore entrance carving

 

My first step is usually to crop the image to focus on the aspects I want to show. In this case, I plan to highlight the human figure to the right of the door. As a hypothetical scenario, let’s say I want to use it for the feature image in a news article about the Biltmore Estate. I like the close-up of the sculpture in *Figure 5.23*, but I want to find a creative way to hide the eave over its head. One way I could achieve this would be to use an image box that cuts off that part, but shows the figure popping out of the top and left-hand sides.

 

To create this effect in Photoshop, I need two image layers: one that has the isolated stone figure, and another that has the background. I start out by duplicating my image several times, making sure to keep one completely unedited version in case I need to go back to step one. For the top layer, I carefully knocked out the figure by zooming in and using the polygonal lasso tool to select the perimeter of the figure and cut off the excess. To create the background image, I used the rounded rectangle tool to create a mask of the area I wanted to show, then dragged the mask onto my background box layer.

 

![The Biltmore image double-cropped with two layers](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000069.jpg)

 

Figure 5.24. The Biltmore image double-cropped with two layers

 

The resulting image in *Figure 5.24* looks quite good, but it could still use some adjustments. The first issue I have is that the grimy areas on the figure’s shoulders and its shield are a bit unsightly. I’m not going to eliminate that completely, but I can take some steps to reduce the contrast in those areas. The tools for this job are the Dodge and Burn tools. The Dodge tool is a brush-like tool that actually lightens the area that you click on, while the Burn tool darkens the area. By using these tools together, I can lighten the dark areas, and darken the light areas, to give the image more consistent shading and contrast.

 

Next, it’s time to adjust the overall brightness and contrast of the two layers. Brightness and contrast are two controls that are provided by just about every image-editing software; they can be accessed in the Photoshop menu through the Image > Adjustments > Brightness/ Contrast… menu options. The controls are shown in *Figure 5.25*.

 

![Photoshop’s Brightness/Contrast controls](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000144.jpg)

 

Figure 5.25. Photoshop’s Brightness/Contrast controls

 

As we learned in Chapter 2, the brightness of an image actually refers to the overall amount of light or darkness in the image. The contrast of an image is the difference between the light and dark areas in the image. Kicking the brightness and contrast of the Biltmore figure up a few notches, and pushing the brightness and contrast of the background block down a bit, will help to give the composition a little more pop.

 

After I adjust the brightness and contrast, I move on to work on the hue and saturation. The Hue and Saturation controller shown in *Figure 5.26* can be accessed through the Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation… menu options. The Hue control affects the overall color of the image. By moving the Hue slider up and down, you can shift the colors in the image so that it appears more blue, or red, or orange, and so on. The overall tone of this image is fine, so I don’t really want to adjust its hue too much, but it’s sometimes necessary to alter the hue if you want to change the overall color of an image. 

The Saturation slider affects how saturated the colors appear within the image. If you turn the saturation off, you’ll be left with a grayscale image, but if you turn it all the way up, all the colors will be brighter and more dramatic. I want to increase the saturation in the image of the figure, and reduce the saturation of the background image. This will further extenuate the contrast, and give the image the pop that I was talking about before.

Figure 5.27. Final image after Photoshop tweaking

 

Finally, the image is just about ready for posting! Notice how the figure in *Figure 5.27* stands out from the background, and the shading is more even than before. These subtle details make a big difference to the overall effect of the image. To adjust a little more of that detail, I applied an outline stroke around the background block by accessing Layer > Layer Style > Stroke… and giving the block an inside black stroke.

 

Besides making brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments, another way to give an image a Photoshop face-lift is by using filters.

 

In photography, a **filter** is a physical attachment for your camera lens that alters the way a photo looks. These filters are used to capture richer colors, compensate for bad lighting, or make an image feel warmer or cooler. Photoshop filters follow this basic idea, although they do much more than a camera lens attachment. They can be used to create artistic effects, distort images, add texture, and much more. Photoshop comes stocked with a great variety of filters. Some of these can be very useful, and some … well, I find them less useful, but suffice to say that there’s something for everyone. For an idea of what’s possible with filters, I opened a picture of some orchids and ran it through a few of the standard filters in Photoshop. *Figure 5.28* shows the results of my experiment.

 

![A sampling of Photoshop filters](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000061.jpg)

 

Figure 5.28. A sampling of Photoshop filters

 

As far as Photoshop effects go, I’ve only shown the tip of the iceberg here. Not even the whole tip—this quick tour has been more like a chip off the tip. There’s so much that you can do within Photoshop, and my best recommendation for learning it all is to tinker. Online tutorials will accelerate that process, but there’s no substitute for solid experience. Open an image and explore what each toolbar button, drop-down item, menu action, and filter can do to that image. Once you’ve messed up that image well enough, open another one and start again.

 

## File Formats and Resolutions

 

No matter which photo-editing program you use, to prepare images for the Web, you’ll need to know a few basics about the standard image file formats and when each should be used. Currently, three image formats are widely supported by web browsers: JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Choosing the format that’s right for your image is a matter of determining which will provide the smallest file size for the highest quality image.

 

JPEG
:    JPEG (.jpg) is an image compression format that was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group specifically to store photographic images. Unlike GIF and PNG images, JPEGs can provide fairly small file sizes at 24-bit color. This makes them great for any type of photography, or graphics with heavy textures or long gradients. Although there’s no limit to the number of colors the JPEG format can display, it’s a lossy format that can create visual artifacts depending on how much you compress the file. When saving a .jpg file, you’ll have to carefully consider the amount of compression you apply. As you can see in *Figure 5.29*, a highly compressed image might be great for page load speed, but if you go as far as I did with the rightmost strawberry, it’s very unappetizing.

    ![An image of a strawberry saved at increasingly higher levels of JPEG compression](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000158.jpg)

    Figure 5.29. An image of a strawberry saved at increasingly higher levels of JPEG compression 

GIF
:    GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is an 8-bit format that compresses files on the basis of the number of colors in the image. Although the compression ratio of the GIF format is good, it supports a maximum of only 256 colors, and is therefore useless for photographic pages. Two nifty features of GIF are that it displays transparency (see figure *Figure 5.30*), and supports animation. In the late 1990s, UNISYS (the company behind the compression algorithm used in GIF images) tried to claim that GIF was a proprietary format, and charged companies royalties for any program that created GIF files. This—as well as the 256-color limitation of the format—led to the creation of the PNG format. Although the GIF format is still widely used on the Web, using PNG instead is strongly encouraged.

    ![A transparent GIF and a 24-bit PNG, shown against different backgrounds](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000203.jpg)

    Figure 5.30. A transparent GIF and a 24-bit PNG, shown against different backgrounds 
    
PNG
:    The PNG (Portable Networks Graphics) format was developed by the W3C as an alternative to GIF. The lossless compression style of the PNG algorithm works similarly to that of GIF, in that files with fewer colors end up having the smallest file sizes. PNG images can be saved in either 8-bit or 24-bit format. Both of these flavors of PNG support transparency, but transparency in 24-bit PNG images is implemented by means of an alpha channel that sits alongside the red, green, and blue channels; this means that each pixel in a PNG image can have up to 256 different levels of opacity. The effects of this difference are illustrated in *Figure 5.30*—notice that you can still see the background image through the PNG image, while the GIF is either completely opaque or completely transparent. 8-bit transparency is like that of the GIF in *Figure 5.30*—it’s either on or off. Therefore, if you plan to put your transparent PNG image over a different background image or texture, you’ll have to modify the image so that the opaque edges match the background. I’m hoping that by the time you read this, we’re no longer coding websites for IE6, but just in case, 24-bit transparency is only supported in IE7 and up. Other than IE6, file size is another reason to consider saving your PNGs as 8-bit. The 24-bit version of an image can be several times the size of its 8-bit cousin

 

## Creative Image Treatments

 

Once you’ve inserted your JPEG, PNG, or GIF image into your web page, you may still find yourself a bit underwhelmed by its presentation. By default, images that are placed on a web page using an HTML `<img>` tag sit inline with the text that surrounds them. A hyperlinked image typically has a rather unattractive blue border. Not a very exciting default presentation, but that’s what CSS is there for. What if you want to give an image a frame like one you might use to display a picture on your wall? What if you want an image to have a border around it that makes it look like a Polaroid picture? Perhaps you want it to have corner tabs like the ones you’d use to stick an image in a photo album. In each of these cases, you have two options: apply your desired effects directly to the photo using image-editing software, or use CSS background images and borders to style the image within your web page.

 

### Using Images to Enhance Images

 

Altering an image to add borders, edge effects, and transparency may seem like minimal hassle. It only takes a few minutes in Photoshop to give a photo the look you want. But problems can arise if you have to give every image on a website the same look. And what would happen if you had to add new images or change any of the existing pics? In either case, a task that would normally involve only a minor change to your HTML, plus a second or two to copy the new photo to the web server, might take half an hour or more. On top of that, the whole point of semantic markup is to separate style from content. An image in the content of a website is just that: a piece of content.

 

With CSS turned off, the [portfolio of graphic and web designer Wing Cheng](http://wingcheng.com/)simply looks like a page full of images, as shown in *Figure 5.31*.

 

![Wing Cheng’s portfolio with CSS turned off](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000188.jpg)

 

Figure 5.31. Wing Cheng’s portfolio with CSS turned off

 

Now take a look at the site with CSS turned on in *Figure 5.32*. The style of Wing’s portfolio is fun, whimsical, and creative. The paper pages angle in and out to give the appearance that it’s a single 3D piece of paper that’s accordion-folded. Each of the folds below the “about” page you see in the screenshot contains a single portfolio item. There are several items for each of the categories, and the site ends with a contact form and then the back cover of the leather sketchbook.

 

![The creative portfolio of Wing Cheng](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000014.jpg)

 

Figure 5.32. The creative portfolio of Wing Cheng

 

If Wing incorporated the alternating page textures into the background of each portfolio item, the file size of each image would be much larger, and the site would have taken a very long time to load. Instead, there are just two different paper textures; one angled in at the bottom and one angled out. These are applied as 24-bit PNG background images on the `div` elements that contain each portfolio item. If she wants to add a new portfolio item, she only needs to shuffle the background images in the CSS, rather than having to recreate all the images for her entire portfolio.

 

In this example, the portfolio images were the content, and they were enhanced by the 3D paper backgrounds placed behind them.

 

### Using Pure CSS to Enhance Images

 

Applying a background or overlay is a great way to give your content images a unique and unified look. Of course, not all CSS-based image effects involve extra images. CSS borders provide myriad possible effects. As you may already know, the standard CSS2 borders have three properties—width, style, and color—which are controlled individually via the `border-width` , `border-style` , and `border-color` properties, and by the shorthand `border` property. The `border-width` and `border-color` properties are fairly self-explanatory. `border-width` sets the thickness of the border using either a CSS measurement (such as 1px or 0.5em) or a keyword (one of `thin` , `medium` , or `thick` ). The `border-color` property takes a hexadecimal color value.

 

The `border-style` property is where the developers of CSS got their creativity on. We have eight visual styles to choose from: `dotted` , `dashed` , `solid` , `double` , `groove` , `ridge` , `inset` , and `outset` —in addition to the invisible values, `none` and `hidden` . You can see these standard styles on display in Figure 5.33.

 

![The eight visible border styles as seen in four different browsers](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000051.jpg)

Figure 5.34. CSS can produce scary borders

 

Even with these slight inconsistencies, each style is clearly distinguished and potentially useful. I use the word “potentially” because, depending on how they’re used, these borders can also be ugly. Just as good typography exists to complement text, a good border should complement the item it surrounds. Borders that are particularly large, or have a lot of color contrast, will distract viewers from the image to which you wish to draw more attention.

 

You can take full advantage of borders’ ugly potential by specifying completely different borders for each side of a block. The ability to specify these values separately can be useful if you want a border on just one side of a block, or if you want to use different colors within the same border. But mixing different styles, colors, and thickness values around the same element or image usually only leads to trouble. As you can see from the scary monkey image in *Figure 5.34*, this approach can produce some fairly horrific results (though I admit that the toy itself fails to help matters).

 

Here’s the CSS I used to create those scary borders:

 

``` img.uglybox { border-top: 20px groove #ff1100; border-right: 16px dotted #66ee33; border-bottom: 8px outset #00aaff; border-left: 12px double #ff00ff;} ```

 

Thankfully, applying different CSS border properties to a single image doesn’t have to be scary. The awesome power of borders can be used just as well for good as they can for evil. One graphic edge effect that designers often want to apply to the images in their designs is a subtle drop shadow or inset or groove to add dimension. I mentioned in Chapter 3 that CSS3 could be used to create drop shadows, but sometimes the effect you’re going for is a little simpler and more subtle—like the one Claire Campbell employs on her site. In the figure below, you can see a real, working CSS digital clock. It was made by creatively manipulating CSS borders.

 

![Subtle groove on Claire's clock](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000160.jpg)

 

Figure 5.35. Subtle groove on Claire's clock

 

While image effects like the ones I’ve described in this section are useful, our ability to enhance HTML images will be greatly enhanced by some of the new features of CSS3. A great example is the final demo from Natalie Downe’s _24 ways_ article, [“Going Nuts with CSS3 Transitions.”](http://24ways.org/2009/going-nuts-with-css-transitions)The demo for the tutorial, seen in *Figure 5.36*, uses CSS3 animation, drop shadow, and rotation/scale transforms to make a standard photo gallery look like a pile of Polaroid photos tossed onto a table.

 

![Natalie Downe’s CSS3 Polaroid images with captions](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000193.jpg)

 

Figure 5.36. Natalie Downe’s CSS3 Polaroid images with captions

 

It’s an exciting time for web design and development; the example above represents just a tiny sliver of the new styling options in CSS3. For a full breakdown of the border properties specifically, I recommend checking out Estelle Weyl’s [Border Properties, Values, and Browser Support](http://www.standardista.com/css3/css3-border-properties) page at _The Standardista_. The main goal with all these display effects is to bring more attention to the images in our content, whether it’s done with creative overlays, simple border properties, or new CSS3 effects. The most important point to remember is that borders and effects should enhance the images they surround, not drown them out. Avoid adding effects that call more attention to themselves than to the photo they’re highlighting.

 

## Application: The Finishing Touches

 

In the last chapter we nailed down the details of the different aspects of the KRG website. We'd decided on our typefaces to create a consistent, inviting atmosphere for Carrie’s clients. So now it's time to refine the imagery. The main content of the site is laid out in a blog-style format, but the home page has a sliding gallery, with news, events, and product announcements that cycle through without the user ever having to scroll.

 

The most important thing about the imagery is that the individual images needed to be inviting, while evoking an emotional connection with visitors. One thing that her old site didn’t do was connect on a personal level with anyone. It was mainly static text, together with an image of Carrie.

 

Using the right content was key in striking an emotional connection with the site visitors. To start the process of finding the right imagery, I searched my business stock photography account for images regarding pain. One of the main images on the site is of a man holding his lower back while sitting in an office atmosphere. This image should connect with anyone in the situation where they’ve had try and make it through the work day, even though they were in pain. Coupled with two simple lines of marketing copy, the message is highly effective.

 

![Making an emotional connection by empathy](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000019.jpg)

 

Figure 5.37. Making an emotional connection by empathy

The three columns of text under the slider also needed some imagery to catch the eye. The first image is a reflexology illustration from a paid stock photography site. This was necessary, because it illustrates the parts of the body affected by reflexology, but in a creative, visual way.

 

The last two images are illustrations, created in Adobe Illustrator. One is a vector illustration of one of the machines KRG uses, shown in *Figure 5.38*. I used a photo for reference, but simplified it, without including any of the words, text or graphics that are usually found on the machine. Many who come to the site don’t have any idea what Reflexology is, so an image of a “mysterious machine” is sure to pique interest. The graphic is simple, yet effective.

 

![The in-progress illustration of the PEMF machine](https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/images/000125.jpg)

 

Figure 5.38. The in-progress illustration of the PEMF machine

 

The third image is a graphic of their thermography, or thermal imaging service. It is a good way to analyze blood flow throughout the body, and a custom graphic to illustrate this concept jumps out to the viewer against the dark green and the stark, sterile background. The position of the arms is a typical pose that’s made while the test is performed.

 

There are a handful of important things to remember when using multiple images in a row:  It’s a good idea to keep them the same height, so they line up, otherwise you may run into alignment issues. Also, I saved each vector graphic as a transparent PNG, so there wouldn’t be a background or box around each image. The columns are close together, and the images wouldn’t have enough breathing room with their backgrounds.

 

Coming up with the inspiration for these images and graphics wasn’t difficult. When I was in Carrie’s office, I just looked around and took in all of the imagery that correlated with her business. Integrating things that I saw when I was at the location ties together her business and her website.

## Onward and Upward

 

One of the most exciting aspects about designing for the Web is the sense of community and interaction that exists among web professionals. Whether it’s on blog comments, Twitter, [Dribbble,](http://dribbble.com/) or even local tech meetups, there are always talented people who are willing to share their opinions, techniques, and expertise. The design community truly is an invaluable resource—but it can also become an unnecessary crutch. I’m always looking for new sources of inspiration, and because there are so many authoritative designers out there who offer their ideas and portfolios online, it would be easy for me to find all the inspiration I need from web design alone. In and of itself, that isn’t so bad, but if every web designer is getting their ideas from other web designers, eventually we’ll all end up with the same designs.

 

While the design principles and guidelines I’ve discussed throughout this book can help you make aesthetically pleasing and practical design decisions, they’re no substitute for character and originality. The most important attributes you can bring to the design table are your own personality, experiences, and interests. These three resources should form the foundations of your design work. If every designer spent less time trying to emulate the latest design trends and more time defining their own style, the Web would be a much more interesting place. While I’d love to be able to tell you how to define your own style, I’m continually trying to learn what this is for myself. I wish you the best of luck in your future design endeavors, and hope you’ve found this book to be both helpful and encouraging as you kick off a career—or hobby—in web design.
