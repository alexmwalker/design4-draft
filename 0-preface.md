**Preface**

When my wife and I moved into our house, one of our first major projects was to update the bath-
room. The horribly gaudy floral wallpaper pattern, along with the gold sink fixtures, obnoxious
mirrors, and tacky lighting, made us feel like we’d stepped into a previous decade every time we
entered the master bathroom. Removing wallpaper is a tough job, but it’s even more difficult when
there are multiple layers of the stuff. This was the case with our bathroom. Apparently the previous
homeowners’taste in wallpaper changed every few years, and rather than stripping off the wallpaper
and starting over, they just covered ugly with more ugly. Ah, the joys of home ownership!

If there’s one thing our renovation adventures have taught me, it’s that there are strong parallels
between designing a room’s decor and designing a good website.

**Good design is about the relationships between the elements involved, and creating a balance
between them.**
Whether we’re talking about a website or bathroom makeover, throwing up a new layer of
wallpaper or changing the background color isn’t a design solution in itself—it’s just part of a
solution. While we removed the wallpaper and rollered some paint onto our bathroom, we also
had to change the light fixtures, remove the gold-trimmed shower doors, replace the mirrors,
upgrade the lighting, paint the cabinets, change the switches and plugs, and scrape off the
popcorn ceilings. If we’d just removed the tacky wallpaper and left all the other stuff, we’d still
have an outdated bathroom. Website design is similar: you can only do so many minor updates
before the time comes to scrap what you have and start over.

**Fads come and go, but good design is timeless.**
Conforming to the latest design trends is a good way to ensure temporary public appeal, but
how long will those trends last? As far as I know, there was hardly ever a time when marquee
and blink tags were accepted as professional web design markup ... but scrolling JavaScript
news tickers,“high readability”hit-counters, and chunky table borders have graced the home
pages of many high-profile sites in the past. These are the shag carpets, sparkly acoustic ceilings,
and faux wood paneling of the web design world. Take a trip in the Internet Wayback Machine,
and look for late-nineties versions of some of the top Fortune 500 and pre-dot-com boom-era
websites. Try to find examples of good and bad design. In the midst of some of the most outdated,
laughable websites, you’re likely to find some pages that still look surprisingly relevant. Most
likely, these designs aren’t dependent on flashy Photoshop filters or trendy image treatments.
As you read this book, keep in mind that good design transcends technology.

**The finishing touches make a big impression.**
I’ve heard it argued recently that deep down, people really love“anti-marketing design.”The
idea is that we trust sites that have an unpolished appearance and feel amateurish. I think this
argument misses the point. No matter what type of website you’re developing, the design should
be as intentional as the functionality. My wife and I didn’t change the functionality of our


```
bathroom with the work that we did. We just fine-tuned the details, but it made a world of dif-
ference. Some people might have been able to live with the bathroom the way it was, but I doubt
you’d find anyone who would say it was exactly what they wanted. Similarly, if you’re spending
time developing a website, you should take time to design it. Under no circumstances should
the design feel unpolished or haphazard. If you want to come off as edgy, anti-marketing, and
non-corporate, then do it, and do it well—but there’s no reason to be ignorant about, or feel
intimidated by, design.
```
```
My goal with this book is simple: to present what I know about designing for the Web in a way that
anyone can understand and apply. Why? Because the basics of website design should be common
knowledge. We all live in and work on an internet that has been blindly covering up ugly with more
ugly since its inception. It’s time to break that chain and make bold moves toward better design.
```
### Who Should Read This Book

```
If you’re squeamish about choosing colors, feel uninspired by a blank browser window, or get lost
trying to choose the right font, this book is for you. I take a methodical approach to presenting tra-
ditional graphic design theory as it applies to today’s website development industry. While the
content is directed towards web programmers and developers, it provides a design primer and rel-
evant examples that will benefit readers at any level.
```
### What’s in This Book

```
This book comprises the following five chapters. You can read them from beginning to end to gain
a complete understanding of the subject, or skip around if you only need a refresher on a particular
topic.
```
```
Chapter 1: Layout and Composition
An awareness of design relies heavily on understanding the spatial relationships that exist
between the individual components of a design. The layout chapter kicks off the design process
by investigating possible page components. With these blocks defined, we discuss some tools
and examples that will help you start your own designs on a solid foundation. To wrap up this
discussion, we’ll examine Knoxville Reflexology, a real client project that we’ll be following
as an example through each chapter.
```
```
Chapter 2: Color
Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of design is the topic of color selection. Chapter 2 sheds
light on this as we delve into both the aesthetic and scientific aspects of color theory. Armed
with these simple guidelines, and some tips for creating harmonious color combinations, you’ll
see how anyone can choose a set of colors that work well together to complement the overall
message of a website. Finally, we’ll learn how the palette for Knoxville Reflexology was chosen.

**Chapter 3:** **_Texture_**
An aspect of web design that’s often overlooked, texture is the key to creating designs that stand
out. By understanding how the individual elements of texture function, you’ll learn how to use
points, lines, and shapes to communicate and support your site’s message on a number of levels.
We’ll then get to see firsthand how subtle textures helped shape the identity and character of
our example website.

**Chapter 4:** **_Typography_**
The importance of typography is undeniable. Type is everywhere, and understanding the
mechanics of written language is essential for any visual designer. In this chapter, we’ll dive
beneath the surface of this rich topic, exploring the basics of the letterform, and investigating
various typeface distinctions.

**Chapter 5:** **_Imagery_**
The necessary companions to any well-designed site are the images and illustrations that grace
its pages. In the final chapter, we’ll discuss what we should look for in the visual elements that
we use on our pages, and locate sources of legitimate supporting imagery. Of course, finding
the right image is often just the beginning. We’ll also learn some image-editing basics before
we see the final steps in our example project.

### Conventions Used in This Book

You’ll notice that we’ve used certain typographic and layout styles throughout the book to signify
different types of information. Look out for the following items.

#### Code Samples

Code in this book will be displayed using a fixed-width font, like so:

```
<h1>A Perfect Summer's Day</h1>
<p>It was a lovely day for a walk in the park. The birds
were singing and the kids were all back at school.</p>
```
Some lines of code are intended to be entered on one line, but we’ve had to wrap them because of
page constraints. A ➥ indicates a line break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should
be ignored:

```
URL.open("http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/05/28/user-style-she
➥ets-come-of-age/");
```
